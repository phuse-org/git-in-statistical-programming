## Idea 1. Git in numbers

Try to get some real world numbers around Git
(So far I will focus in Github)

### How is the adoption of Git around the world from the last 5 years till now?


- We can see that the adoption increase across the world since 2020 till 2025

### How many "statisticians in healthcare" use Git.



## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
