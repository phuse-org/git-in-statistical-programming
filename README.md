- Using Git for audit trails
- How Git can work with the current QC process
- How Git is typically used outside of statistical programming and why
- What the QC process could look like when using the benefits of a typical Git framework
- Regulatorsâ€™ point of view

3. Core education on Git for statistical programmers
4. Soft proposal for an alternative QC process using Git features
