2. PHUSE white paper on Git for statistical programming, to cover:

- The case for Git
- Challenges in using Git
- Current QC process
- Using Git for audit trails
- How Git can work with the current QC process
- How Git is typically used outside of statistical programming and why
- What the QC process could look like when using the benefits of a typical Git framework
