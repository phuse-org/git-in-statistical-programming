## Branching Strategies

Defining a branching strategy can be tricky and requires to identify the needs of each repository. While there is no best branching strategies, this part provides a few examples of what could be considered as potential branching strategies.

There is no need to define one single branching strategy for all of the repository of a company or institution. The choice should be made by type of activity.

### About branches

[This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) explains what a branch is and how it's working.

## Basic git structure

The basic structure of a git repository relies on a principal branch called **main**, which will be duplicated in **sub-branches** that will in the end merged back to the main branch through a pull request.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-basic-git-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Basic Git branching structure"

%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor':'#87CEEB'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "Start"
    commit id: "Branch a"
    branch feature-a
    checkout feature-a
    commit id: "Commit a1"
    checkout main
    merge feature-a tag: "PR: Merge feature-a"
    commit id: "Merge A"
    
    checkout main
    commit id: "Branch b"
    branch feature-b
    checkout feature-b
    commit id: "Commit b1"
    checkout main
    merge feature-b tag: "PR: Merge feature-b"
    commit id: "Merge B"
```

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-basic-git-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Basic Git branching structure"
flowchart TD
    main["Main branch"]
    feature-a("Feature A branch")
    feature-b("Feature B branch")
    PR1>"Pull request"]
    PR2>"Pull request"]
    main --> feature-a
    feature-a --> PR1
    PR1 --> main
    main --> feature-b
    feature-b --> PR2
    PR2 --> main
```

This branching strategy can be used in the case of a team working on a specific activity of a single clinical study within a repository.

It could potentially be used for a study or a product with several distinct activities using flags (see [Branch locking and flagging](##%20Branch%20locking%20and%20flagging)).

## Usage of a devel branch

A devel branch is usually a development branch located between the main and other specific development branches. It is used to integrate multiple features and updated before all of those are merged with the main branch. The main objective is to ensure stability of interdependent updates. It is possible that two different features, which work fine in separate branches, may cause conflicts when merged into the same branch. The devel branch is used to integrate all updated features and make any necessary final adjustments before merging into the main branch. It's working as a safety net before the final merge to main.

The figure below shows an example of the usage of the devel branch. The two feature branches are working without any problem separately, but removing ADAE.ARELGRP1 causes a conflict issue in the devel branch. This conflict should be resolved before merging into main.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-devel-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Devel branch structure"

%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor':'#87CEEB'}}}%%
gitGraph
    commit
    branch devel
    checkout devel
    commit
    branch feature-1
    checkout feature-1
    commit
    checkout devel
    merge feature-1
    branch feature-2
    checkout feature-2
    commit
    checkout devel
    merge feature-2
    checkout main
    merge devel
```

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-devel-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Devel branch structure"
flowchart TD
    main["Main branch"]
    devel(["Devel branch"])
    feature-1("Feature 1 branch")
    feature-2("Feature 2 branch")
    pr1>"Pull request"]
    pr2>"Pull request"]
    main --> devel
    devel --> feature-1
    devel -.-> feature-2
    feature-1 --> pr1
    feature-2 -.-> pr2
    pr1 --> devel
    pr2 -.-> devel
    devel ==> |"Resolve conflicts"| main
```

A devel branch is very useful in the following cases:

-   Several of different people are working on the same time on different features

-   The features can present interdependancies

In the case of a single or a little group of persons working together, or when tasks have no interdependancies, the devel branch could be avoided.

An example of workflow using a devel branch is detailled at [this link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

## One main branch duplicated per milestone

Several clinical studies relies on the same base programs for several milestone, while some milestones require some specific programs. Storing everything in the main branch and duplicate it for the final step of a milestone is an option.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-dup-milestone-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Main branch duplicated per milestone structure"
flowchart TB
    main["Main branch"]
    csr(["CSR"])
    dmc1(["DMC #1"])
    dmc2(["DMC #2"])
    main -.-> csr
    main -.-> dmc1
    main -.-> dmc2
    flag_csr[("Flag #1")]
    flag_dmc1[("Flag #2")]
    flag_dmc2[("Flag #3")]
    csr -.-> flag_csr
    dmc1 -.-> flag_dmc1
    dmc2 -.-> flag_dmc2
```

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-dup-milestone-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Main branch duplicated per milestone structure"
flowchart TB
    subgraph Main["Main Branch"]
        main["Main Branch"]
        feature-1["Feature #1"]
        pr1["Pull request"]
        main --> feature-1
        feature-1 --> pr1
        pr1 --> main
        feature-2["Feature #2"]
        pr2["Pull request"]
        main --> feature-2
        feature-2 --> pr2
        pr2 --> main
    end

    subgraph Milestones["Tag releases"]
        milestone-1["DMC branch"]
        milestone-2["CSR branch"]
        tag-1["Tag #1"]
        tag-2["Tag #2"]
        main --> milestone-1
        main --> milestone-2
        milestone-1 --> tag-1
        milestone-2 --> tag-2
    end
```

A branch can be locked using a [protection rule (see #13)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule).

## One main branch per milestone

A single study often needs to deal with different activities, sometime happening at the same moment. One potential way to use git in theses cases could be to have:

-   1 repository for the study

-   **1 main branch per activity** (CSR, DMC #n, DSUR, etc)

This branching strategy would allow to work separately on each activity, keeping them intact, but also to work on both at the same moment if needed. The following examples shows a repository dedicated to a single study with the 2 following main branches:

-   CSR: for daily ongoing activities related to the CSR preparation

-   DMC #1: specific milestone happening soon

Two issues are handled at the same moment. Issue #1 is dedicated to an efficacy endpoint that should not be part of the DMC, while Issue #2 is stricly dedicated to the DMC activity and will not be part of the final CSR outputs.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-milestone-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "One branch per milestone structure"
flowchart TD
    csr["CSR"]
    dmc["DMC"]
    branch-1("Branch #1")
    branch-2("Branch #2")
    pr1>"Pull request"]
    pr2>"Pull request"]
    csr --> branch-1
    dmc --> branch-2
    branch-1 --> pr1
    pr1 --> |"Merge #1"| csr
    branch-2 --> pr2
    pr2 --> |"Merge #2"| dmc
```

### Common issue

If something common to more than one of the main branches should be made, it is possible to make as much pull requests as requested. The only tricky part is to define the source branch. In this example, we take the CSR.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-common-issue-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Common issue branch structure"
flowchart TB
    csr["CSR"]
    dmc["DMC"]

    branch-c("Common issue branch")
    prc>"Pull request"]

    csr --> branch-c --> prc

    prc --> csr
    prc --> dmc
```

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-common-issue-branch-structure
%%| fig-cap: "Common issue branch structure"
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'subgraphBkgColor':'transparent', 'subgraphBorderColor':'transparent'}}}%%
flowchart TB
    subgraph Top[" "]
        direction LR
        csr["CSR"]
        dmc["DMC"]
    end
    branch-c("Common issue branch")
    prc>"Pull request"]
    csr --> branch-c
    branch-c --> prc
    prc -->|"Merge common issue"| csr
    prc -->|"Merge common issue"| dmc
```

## Pros and cons

Many other strategies can be defined, and the choice depends on the needs of each study team. Also, some of the strategies displayed above can be combined (for instance using a deven branch with a milestone main branch strategy).

Here is a summary of the different pros and cons of the different strategies presented above:
