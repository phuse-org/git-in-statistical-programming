## What is GitHub Desktop?

[**Github Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/) is a **free and open-source** software that provides a **graphical user interface** to use git instead of using the prompts. It means you don't need to learn how to use the command lines to have a proper usage of Git.

### Features

It allows you to:

-   Clone a repository to your local environment

-   Rebase your current branch

-   Write commit messages and push branches to your distant repository

-   Open a pull request

And a lot more.
