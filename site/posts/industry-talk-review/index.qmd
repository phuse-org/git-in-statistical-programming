# Introduction

The usage of Git in clinical programming within the pharmaceutical industry has been steadily increasing over the last several years. Beyond the discussions of our PHUSE working group, several talks at recent industry events have showcased how various companies are leveraging this technology.

# Search Strategy

The search for materials spanned a few major conferences over the past few years. The PHUSE archive was the primary resource utilized, as heavy representation from pharmaceutical companies is customary for PHUSE events. In addition, talks from the Posit Conference were evaluated, as this is a major open-source technology event which typically includes at least a small degree of representation from the pharmaceutical industry.
