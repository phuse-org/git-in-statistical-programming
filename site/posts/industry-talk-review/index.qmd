# Introduction

The usage of Git in clinical programming within the pharmaceutical industry has been steadily increasing over the last several years. Beyond the discussions of our PHUSE working group, several talks at recent industry events have showcased how various companies are leveraging this technology.

# Search Strategy

The search for materials spanned the 2025 PHUSE archive, as heavy representation from pharmaceutical companies is customary for PHUSE events. 

The aim is not only to summarize how companies are leveraging Git, but to evaluate applications of open-source technology and propose how Git can be useful.
