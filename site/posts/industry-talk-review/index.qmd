# Introduction

The usage of Git in clinical programming within the pharmaceutical industry has been steadily increasing over the last several years. Beyond the discussions of our PHUSE working group, several talks at recent industry events have showcased how various companies are leveraging this technology.

# Search Strategy

The search for materials spanned the 2025 PHUSE archive, as heavy representation from pharmaceutical companies is customary for PHUSE events. 

The aim is not only to summarize how companies are leveraging Git, but to evaluate applications of open-source technology and propose how Git can be useful.

# Major Themes

## Increasing Usage of Open-Source Programming

(Andhale & Sood, 2025)
- R is powerful language for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing within the industry
- Clean data, apply stats models, and implement ML algorithms all within single platform
- Shiny allows visualizing large datasets that are common in this industry, and get actionable insights
- HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge not required --> so lowered barrier for getting more people into open-source programming
- Interactive elements for deeper data exploration
- Integrate data from several sources, across studies, leverage historical data
- More flexibility to meet diverse needs of stakeholders
- Scalability important for exponentially increasing amounts of data due to multicenter international trials

## Rise of Agile Methologies

(Andhale & Sood, 2025)
- becoming more common
- Real-time communication and iterative progress in workflows

## Need for Version Control

(Andhale & Sood, 2025)
- Important to support agile and collaborative development
- Particulary useful for complex projects


## GxP Compliance

(Andhale & Sood, 2025):
- All open source packages used for regulatory submissions must be validated (proven to meet regulatory standards), documented, and controlled in SCE
- Must be traceability of all code changes
- Allows reproducibility of all versions of code

## Collaborative Learning Communities

(Andhale & Sood, 2025)
- For R programming
