# Git in Statistical Programming 

Git is by far the most popular version control system, with nearly 95% reporting it as their primary system in 2022. Despite this, uptake in the pharmaceutical industry has been much slower. To bridge this gap, our PHUSE working group was formed, bringing together representatives from diverse organizations to explore how Git can be effectively utilized in the context of statistical reporting.

This talk will introduce the working group, present some of our work so far, and discuss how you can get involved. We will delve into the ways Git is already being employed in statistical programming, and examine how various companies are tackling the challenges of change management. We will introduce our blog which is already full of rich content, and talk about our plans for a white paper, coming out later this year.

We believe that adoption of Git can help streamline workflows, enhance collaboration and make work more reproducible. Join us as we work toward building a more efficient and collaborative future for statistical reporting.
