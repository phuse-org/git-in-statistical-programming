# The Use of Git in Statistical Programming

Git has achieved over 90% adoption among programmers, providing powerful capabilities such as code reproducibility, streamlined collaboration, and robust audit trails. Yet, despite these strategic advantages, the pharmaceutical industry has lagged notably behind other sectors in embracing this transformative technology.

This trend is shifting as more major pharmaceutical companies embrace open-source tools, recognizing Git as essential for change tracking, auditability, and transparency in analyses. To accelerate this transition, our PHUSE Emerging Trends and Innovation working group has assembled representatives from diverse organizations to address industry-specific challenges and establish best practices for implementing Git in statistical reporting environments.

This presentation will showcase real-world applications where Git is already enhancing statistical programming workflows, introduce our collaborative working group initiative, and explore our expanding repository of resourcesâ€”including our content-rich blog and upcoming white paper. Join us as we bridge the gap between Git's proven potential and its practical implementation in pharmaceutical statistical reporting.
